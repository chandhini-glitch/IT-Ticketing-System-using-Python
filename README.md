## System Workflow
1. Users report IT issues by entering problem details into the system  
2. The system generates a unique ticket ID for tracking  
3. Tickets move through defined stages:
   - Open  
   - In Progress  
   - Resolved  
   - Closed  
4. Users can view and update existing tickets  
5. All tickets can be listed for monitoring and review  
6. The system logs actions, resolution time, and recurring issue patterns
